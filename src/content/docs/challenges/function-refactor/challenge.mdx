description: Function Refactor - The Challenge
---

## Task Overview
Refactor the `executeStandardPTOperations` function in Node.js, where "PT" stands for "Purs transaction". Additionally, write a unit test for this function.

### Objectives
1. **Refactor the function:**
   - Improve readability, maintainability, testability, and understandability.
   - Comment the code as needed.
   - Optimize for latency where possible.
   - Fix any anti-patterns, sloppiness, or potential bugs.

2. **Write Unit Tests:**
   - Choose any testing framework.
   - Ensure comprehensive test coverage.
   - Tests should be readable and clearly indicate the test cases.
   - Tests should fail if significant logic changes are made to the function.

### Key Points
- The code was functional when retired, so no bugs are expected.
- Some variables, such as `insertfedNowPaymentSQL`, are not defined and can be set as constants.
- Mock the RDS calls.
- Creative freedom is allowed, but language changes are limited to Golang or a JS framework.
- State all assumptions in a comment or a separate markdown file.

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Refactoring:** Focus on readability, maintainability, testability, and error/bug handling.
- **Unit Testing:** Emphasize readability and coverage of tests.
