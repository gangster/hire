## Work Experience

### [Prismatic](https://www.prismatic.io/)
#### Senior Backend Engineer | March 2023 - November 2023
- **CI/CD Pipeline Development:** Developed multiple GitLab CI/CD pipelines, significantly improving lead times for various projects.
- **Container Image Standardization:** Designed minimal container images with key language runtimes and tools (e.g., Node.js, Python, AWS SDK, Terraform), using GitLab pipelines for efficient builds. Stored in the internal GitLab registry for seamless deployment in services and CI jobs.
- **Repository Optimization:** Led the restructuring of a large monorepo into separate repositories, boosting team productivity and deployment agility.
- **Documentation Generator:** Transitioned a complex Python-based documentation generator to TypeScript, streamlining and enhancing the release process for our product documentation website.

### [Ontra](https://ontra.ai/)
#### Lead DevOps Engineer | September 2019 - November 2022
- **Leadership:** Led a team of 4 DevOps engineers, responsible for defining the roadmap for the team, defining requirements for items on the roadmap, and driving projects to completion.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Led the adoption of AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) to automate and streamline our sophisticated, multi-account AWS infrastructure, achieving efficient and manageable code-driven configurations.
- **Pull Request Environment Automation:** Implemented a CI/CD pipeline that activates upon a pull request, automating the creation of an isolated test environment. This process includes provisioning AWS resources with CDK, setting up S3 buckets and databases, building front and back-end applications, containerizing services, deploying them to an AWS EKS Kubernetes cluster, and configuring domain routing and SSL certificates. This system allows for seamless testing of each commit in isolation, enhancing both developer experience and testing efficiency. Upon merging or closing the pull request, the pipeline automatically destroys all provisioned resources, maintaining resource efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
- **Developer Onboarding:** Utilized Ansible to streamline the setup of new developer environments, reducing the initial configuration time from several days to just a few hours. This enhancement not only accelerated the onboarding process but also minimized initial setup complexities, allowing developers to begin productive work more quickly and with less initial overhead. The single-command automation ensured a consistent and error-free environment setup, contributing to a smoother integration into the development team and workflow.
- **GitLab Migration:** Orchestrated a successful migration to GitLab, streamlining the development and deployment workflow.

### [Wurl](https://wurl.com/)
#### Senior Infrastructure Engineer | April 2018 - August 2019
- **Media Ingestion Pipeline:** Created a new mixed-media ingestion pipeline, based on AWS serverless technologies such as Lambda, Fargate, and Step Functions, resulting in improved system reliability and performance.
- **Log Analysis Tool:** Developed a high-performance HTTP log analysis tool in Go, that computed engagement metrics and exported them into Tableau for further analysis.
- **Full Stack Development**: Enhanced the Rails/React customer-facing web application by designing and implementing key features, improving user experience and application functionality in collaboration with the product team.

### Other Roles
#### Senior Full Stack Engineer | January 1998 - January 2018
- Contributed significantly to various software development projects at companies like PolicyGenius, Jibe, OkCupid Labs, VMWare, and Microsoft.
